Welcome to my version of minesweeper on Android.

Aren't there like a million minesweeper games out there? - Yup

Well, then how is this any different? - I'll tell you :)

Features:

* A solver which tells you if you missed a move. Basically, the feature will tell you if you can logically figure out something in the given position. A lot of the time, I'll play minesweeper and get stuck. When that happens, I want to know if I missed anything. Is there a mine/free cell which I could have logically figured out?

* Mine probabilities for unknown cells. Let's say there's nothing more to be figured out, and you have to guess. The app will tell you which cell has the lowest probability of being a mine.

* Never guess mode. Consider this situation: you tap on a cell which happens to be a mine, but there exists a configuration of mines such that the tapped cell isn't a mine. Then in never guess mode, the app will rearrange the mines such that your tapped cell is free, effectively resulting in you always guessing correctly. No more 50-50 guesses at the end!

* Always guess wrong mode. Basically the same as above, but you always guess wrong. Effectively, this results in you having to always logically figure out stuff.
