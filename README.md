Welcome to my version of minesweeper on Android.

Aren't there like a million minesweeper games out there? - Yup

Well, then how is this any different? - I'll tell you :)

I plan on implementing a feature which tells you if you missed a move.

Basically, the feature will tell you if you can logically figure out something in the given position.

A lot of the time, I'll play minesweeper and get stuck. When that happens, I want to know if I missed anything. Is there a bomb/free cell which I could have logically figured out? And the goal is to become better at the game.
